# SafePortfolioMaker

CFM 101 Group Assignment: This program creates a safe portfolio given a ticker list (in a csv file) of stocks. The algorithm using statistically analyzed calculations and several methods of risk measurement to create this targeted portfolio and includes thorough written analysis and graph interpretation of the data.

I worked with two group members to create a Python program in Jupyter Notebook which takes in a CSV file of tickers and goes through a filtering process using several calculations and libraries like Yahoo Finance, NumPy Financial, Matplotlib and more. Numerical, graphical and thorough written analysis were implemented within, as well as reasonings to why the chosen calculations of risk were used and how it affects the selection process. Ultimately, it generates a list of 10-20 tickers that would generate the safest portfolio based on measures such as standard deviation, beta, correlation, and so on.
